        When creating the worm movement for our game, I knew I wanted it to be more 
        than just a straight line that would move around here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
        I began implementing the worm by starting with a line2D in godot, which allowed me to have segments of the worm connected together, and render it. 
        However, there is no native collision detection for a line, and I needed to be able to tell
        if something collided with the worm, be it a spear or the player trying to select it. 
        To fix this, I added multiple Colider2d's to the worm, added segment colliders to each, and aligned their positions with each segment of the line2D.

        The worm needed a head, so I added a sprite for it, and updated the rotation of the head sprite to line up 
        with the direction of the starting line2D point to the second point.

            {
                m_HeadSprite.FlipV = true;
            }else{
                m_HeadSprite.FlipV = false;
            }
            m_HeadSprite.LookAt(m_BodyLine2D.GetPointPosition(1) + Position);

        This worked, but I wanted the worm to feel more... wormy. So I started thinking of ways to make the 
        worm move like it should, and decided that I could make the the worm scrunch in the middle as it 
        travelled. In order to do this, I needed two things: alter the distance of a segment over time with sin, 
        and know how to scale this scrunch more in the middle of the worm. The latter, now that I think about it, 
        probably wasn't necessary, but I think it looks good in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started with solving the scaling problem by first getting the minimum distance of a point from both ends of the line2d.
        This is what that value might look like at each point in the worm:
    </p>
    <h5 class="text-center">
        0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 0
    </h5>
    <p>
        This was good, but because i wanted to multiply this value to the distance each segment should be, 
        and i wanted the inside segments to be smaller, i needed to change it up.
        To fix it, I subtracted the value from half of the total segments, which looks like this:
    </p>
    <h6>segments: 7</h6>
    <h6>ceil half: 4</h6>
    <h5 class="text-center">
        4 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4
    </h5>
    <p>
        Now that I had this, i divided the values by that half value again, in order to get a scale from 1 - 1/n - 1:
    </p>
    <h5 class="text-center">1 - 3/4 - 2/4 - 1/4 - 2/4 - 3/4 - 1</h5>
    <p>
        Now having a way to get a smaller number in the middle of the list of points, 
        I can scale it while maintaining a value of 1 at the ends by taking the value and 
        raising it to the power of a strength value. This ends up working really well, 
        because at a strength of 0, all segments are length 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that I had a way of scrunching the worm, I just needed to do it over time. I raised the value to the power of sin(time) * scrunchStrength, and the result was pretty good after tweaking some variables!
